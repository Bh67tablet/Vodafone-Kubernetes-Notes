Create a replica Set, pods may be scheduled on worker1 and worker2

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
 name: myrs
spec:
 replicas: 3
 selector:
  matchLabels:
   type: webserver
 template:
  metadata:
   labels:
    type: webserver
  spec:
   containers:
    - name: c1
      image: nginx


On the master node taint one of the node - worker1

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoSchedule

This node will be tainted

Scale up the replicas, no pod will be scehduled on the tainted node.

# kubectl scale replicaset myrs --replicas=6

This is tainting. 

Now remove the taint:

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoSchedule-


We have 2 types of effect in taint

NoSchedule
NoExecute

Example of NoExecute : in this case the running pods on the node that is tainted will leave the node and get created somewhere else
No new pod will be scheduled on the taineted node as No execute.

Now taint one of the node as :

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoExecute

You will observe that pods form tainted node are terminated


Tolerations:
*********************

first taint a node with a key and value

kubectl taint node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-7fe774cd-0m0q color=red:NoSchedule
